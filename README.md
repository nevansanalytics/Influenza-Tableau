# Data Immersion: Achievements 1 & 2 - Preparing for Influenza Season

## Project Overview
The goal is to assist a medical staffing agency in planning for the upcoming influenza season. This involves analyzing trends in influenza to proactively determine staffing needs across the United States.

### Business Requirements
- **Motivation:** During influenza season, additional staff is crucial in treating patients. The agency provides temporary staff.
- **Objective:** Determine when and how many staff to send to each state.
- **Scope:** Covering hospitals in all 50 states, planning for the influenza season.

### Stakeholder Identification
- Medical agency frontline staff
- Hospitals and clinics utilizing agency services
- Influenza patients
- Staffing agency administrators

### Success Factors
- Staffing plan utilizing all available staff per state requirements.
- Minimal instances of understaffing or overstaffing across states.

## Assumptions & Constraints
**Assumptions:**
- Vulnerable populations suffer the most severe impacts.
- Flu shots decrease flu infection chances.
**Constraints:**
- Limited number of medical personnel.
- No budget for additional hires.

### Requirements
- Plan staffing based on data insights.
- Determine seasonal patterns of influenza across states.
- Prioritize states with high vulnerable population counts.

## Data Sets
The analysis involves multiple data sets covering:
1. Influenza deaths by geography (CDC)
2. Population data by geography, time, age, and gender (US Census Bureau)
3. Influenza laboratory test results by state (CDC - Fluview)
4. Survey of flu shot rates in children (CDC)

## Analysis Criteria
- Data cleaning explanation.
- Integration of at least two relevant data sets.
- Hypothesis identification and testing.
- Correlation analysis between variables.
- Inclusion of spatial and temporal visualizations.
- Conclusions, recommendations, and next steps in the final presentation.

## Project Deliverables (Achievements 1 & 2)
The project involves a series of exercises focusing on planning, data preparation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and storytelling.
